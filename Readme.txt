Will be a webservice kind of like netflix that has a database of videos
and optionally audio files.

This is an exercise in programming.

The web service will be done with php just because all the cheap host
support php and if I ever need to scale php will do fine.

The client will be .net winforms.

The web client will be php/html/javascript(jquery)/css
